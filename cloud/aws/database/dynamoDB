- It is a partitioned B-tree structure.
- It is immediately consistent and hihgly durable.


Trade-off while choosing:
------------------------
- You need to pull the data and do the processing at app end. (Ex: Finding value of all orders for a customer)
- Storing 1TB data is 10 times as that stored in S3
- Cost optimization: On-demand costs $1.25 per million writes, and $0.25 per million reads
- Provisioned capacity: On paper, that same workload that cost $1/day to serve 1 million pages would only cost $0.14/day 
with provisioned capacity, which seems like a very spectacular cost reduction. However, this calculation assumes that:

1)Requests are evenly distributed over the course of the day
2)There is absolutely zero capacity headroom. (You would get throttled if there were a million and one requests in a day.)
Obviously, both of these assumptions are impractical. In reality, youâ€™re going to have to provide abundant headroom in order to deal 
with the peak request rate,as well as to handle any general uncertainty in demand. With provisioned capacity, 
you will have the burden to monitor your utilization and proactively provision the necessary capacity.

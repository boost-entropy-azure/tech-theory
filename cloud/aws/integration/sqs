- SQS is a highly-durable queue in the cloud
- duplicate messages can emerge within SQS, so your consumers should be prepared to handle this situation

# If you really need strict ordering and exactly-once delivery (no duplicates):
- SQS has an option to enable this property by marking your queue as FIFO.
- But these FIFO queues come with a throughput limit of 300 messages per second, 
so they’re only viable if you’re certain that your message rate will remain well clear of that limit.

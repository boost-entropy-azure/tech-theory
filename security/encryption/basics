Types of encryptions are:
------------------------
1) Symmetric Encryption:
- In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. 
- as the max length is 256 bits.

2)Asymmetric Encryption:
- the sender and receiver use a separate key to encrypt and decrypt the message. 
This is also known as PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).

The recipient sends a public key to all the senders. The senders then encrypt the messages using this public key. 
When the receiver receives the message, it uses its private key to decrypt the message. 
The keys used in asymmetric encryption are fairly large and can be around 2048 bits.

Since the asymmetric encryption is very slow, it is normally used once to exchange the encryption key safely. 
After that, all the communication is done using symmetric encryption.


Some encryption algorithms are:

AES
DES
Blowfish
TwoFish
RC4, RC5, RC6

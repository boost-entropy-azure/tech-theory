- Also known as  cookie-based authentication.

Below are the steps to create a session between a user and a web server.

1) The user (normally a browser) sends a request to the server. The request contains the login credentials of the 
user and the info it is requesting.
2) The web server authenticates the user. It creates a session and stores all the information about the user in 
memory or a database and returns a sessionId to the user.
3) This sessionId is stored by the user in browser cookies. The next time the user makes a request it sends the 
cookies as well in the HTTP header.
4) The web server looks at the sessionId and checks if it has any info regarding this sessionId.
5) If the sessionId is valid then the web server recognizes the user and returns the requested information.

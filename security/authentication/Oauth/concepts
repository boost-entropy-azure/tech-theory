- OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. 
- OAuth is a protocol that simplifies the process of providing authorization to clients to access secured resources.
- OAuth is an authorization framework that allows a client app (PicsArt App) to retrieve information from another system 
using a token which is valid for a limited time. The application users authorize the client app to retrieve information 
on their behalf.
- OAuth should only be used for authorization.

Resource owner:
--------------
The resource owner is the owner of the resource that is being accessed. When you log in to PicsArt App using your 
Facebook account, you are granting access to PicsArt to access your images. In this case, you are the resource owner.

Client:
-------
The client is an application that accesses protected resources on behalf of the resource owner. 

Resource server:
----------------
The server that is hosting the protected resources and is capable of accepting 
and responding to requests by clients using access tokens.

Authorization server:
---------------------
The server which issues access tokens after successfully authenticating a client and resource owner is called authorization server.

Authorization grant:
--------------------
An authorization grant is a credential representing the resource owner’s authorization (to access its protected resources) 
used by the client to obtain an access token. The OAuth specification defines four grant types,

Authorization code:
-------------------
In our example, we showed that the Facebook App shared a token with the client. In some OAuth flows, the authorization 
server does not give the access token directly. It first issues an authorization grant. The client then sends this grant 
with the client secret  to the authorization server. After this, the authorization server gives access token to the client.

Access token:
-------------
An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and 
durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.

Scope:
------
Scope defines the permissions of a token. It defines what resources can be accessed using a given access token. 
In our example, the client app wants to access only images, so the images are scope.

Grant type:
-----------
In OAuth 2.0, the term grant type refers to the way an application gets an access token. Each grant type is optimized for 
a particular use, whether that’s a web app, a native app, a device without the ability to launch a web browser, 
or server-to-server applications.

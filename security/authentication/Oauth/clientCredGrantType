Client Credentials Grant Type:
-------------------------------
- This grant type is used for machine to machine authorization.
- If one internal server needs to access some data from the other server, then they can use the client credentials grant type.

How it works?
-------------
1) In this flow, there is a direct token request. Since no user is involved, the client directly sends an HTTP Post 
request to the authorization server.

The query parameters sent with the request are:

grant_type: Since we are requesting the access token using the client credentials, this parameter will contain client_credentials.

client_id: The client id of the app.

client_secret: The client secret of the app.

scope: The optional parameter defining the resources being requested.

POST /token/endpoint HTTP/1.1
 
  Host: authserver.dummy.com
 
grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=12345
&client_secret=gh5Gdkj743HFG45udbfGfs
&scope=images_read

2) If the client credentials are valid, a token is returned by the authorization server.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
{
  "access_token":"YT3774ghsghdj6t4GJT5hd",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "refresh_token":"YT768475hjsdbhdgby6434hdh",
  "scope":"images_read"
}

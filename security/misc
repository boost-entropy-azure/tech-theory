Why low-priority services should be on a separate domain #
“What’s the harm”, you say? I would counter that using your main domain to store low-priority services can harm your main 
business, and you could be in a lot of trouble. Even though there’s nothing inherently wrong with using subdomains to serve 
different services, you might want to think about offloading low-priority 
services to a different domain, the reasoning behind this choice is that, if the service running on the different TLD gets 
compromised, it will be much harder for attackers to escalate the exploit to your main service(s).

As we’ve seen, cookies are often shared across multiple subdomains (by setting the domain attribute to something like 
*.example.com, .example.com or simply example.com), so a scenario could play out where you install a popular blogging 
software like WordPress on engineering-blog.example.com and run with it for a few months, forget to upgrade the software 
and install security patches as they get published.

Later, an XSS in the blogging platform allows an attacker to dump all cookies present on your blog somewhere in his 
control, meaning that users who are logged onto your main service (example.com) who visit your engineering blog could 
have their credentials stolen. If you had kept the engineering blog on a separate domain, such as engineering-blog.example.io, 
that would not have been possible.

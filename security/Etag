In todayâ€™s web, there are other ways to keep track of users, ETag tracking being one example. Since cookies are usually 
associated with tracking, these techniques are often referred to as supercookies as well, even though they do not rely on 
HTTP cookies. Other terms that may refer to the same set of technologies and practices are permacookies 
(permanent cookies) or zombiecookies (cookies that never die).

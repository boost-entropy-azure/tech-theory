- An HTTP message (either a request or a response) contains multiple parts:

start line
headers
body

#Some header advice:

When using custom headers, it is always preferred to prefix them with a key so that they won’t conflict 
with other headers that might become standard in the future. Historically, this worked until everyone started to use 
“non-standard” X prefixes which, in turn, became the norm. The X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers are examples of 
custom headers that are widely used and understood by load balancers and proxies, even though they weren’t part of the HTTP standard.

If you need to add your own custom header, it’s generally better to use a vendor prefix, like Acme-Custom-Header or A-Custom-Header.

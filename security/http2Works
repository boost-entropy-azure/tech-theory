- H2 was geared towards speeding the process up. H2 uses binary rather than plaintext messages, supports multiplexing, 
and uses the HPACK algorithm to compress headers. To make a long story short, H2 was a performance boost to HTTP/1.1.

- With H2, which is encrypted by default, there are no more excuses as features like multiplexing and server push make 
it perform better than plain HTTP/1.1.

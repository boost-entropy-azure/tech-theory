That’s why it’s so important to focus not on exposing on your company’s 
internal infrastructure but on the experience that an outside developer should have when interacting with your API.

There are tools that help you to describe the interface of an API in a structured way that can be used to generate documentation and run your tests. 
Additionally, a subset of these tools also allows you to specify data types and custom data types. Some examples are json:api, JSON Schema, and Apache Avro.

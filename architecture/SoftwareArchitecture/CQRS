Why CQRS?
- Simultaneous txns lead to data contentions and conflicts
- Service and data source with mixed read and write are expensive to scale.
- Security is not granular based on read and write.

CQRS:
----
- There can be separate DB or same DB
- The service are split into two: One solely for read and other solely for write, update, delete.

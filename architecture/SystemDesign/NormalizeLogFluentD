To do this, we use the adapter pattern with a redis container as the main application container, 
and the fluentd container as our adapter container. In this case, we will also use the fluent-plugin-redis-slowlog 
fluentd plugin to listen to the slow queries. 
We can configure this plugin using the following snippet:

<source>
  type redis_slowlog
  host localhost
  port 6379
  tag redis.slowlog
</source>

Configure apache storm:

<source>
  type storm
  tag storm
  url http://localhost:8080
  window 600
  sys 0
</source>

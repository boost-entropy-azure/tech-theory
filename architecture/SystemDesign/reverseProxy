Reverse proxy or HTTP accelerators. HTTP Accelerators can be used to improve the response time to remote users. 
There are commercially available products that can serve as good reverse proxies.

The accelerators act as a forward proxy for multiple HTTP clients. By examining the headers of the resources, 
the accelerator can understand which objects can be cached. So, it saves static objects in memory-based or disk-based 
object cache. Whenever the user requests those objects, they had retrieved from the cache itself. Even though 
the accelerator is smart enough to cache only the objects that have the required headers (Cache-Control and pragma), 
it could be configured to exclude specific objects from caching.

It makes use of the HTTP header (Last-Modified) to detect if the static object is still fresh. If the object has 
been modified, it will retrieve the latest copy of the object and send it to the user. The configuration allows us 
to disable specific objects from being cached. We can configure disabling caching enforcement by modifying the 
conditional request from the browser. Sometimes for some kinds of static objects, including stylesheets and scripts, 
the browser may send a conditional request to the server. If this object is not available in this HTTP accelerator, 
we can modify the request and move the condition so that the server is forced to respond with the object that would 
later be saved in the proxy. We can also configure it to enable web server compression. Just FYI, mostly the proxy has 
a better compression than the web server. However, this is just one configuration option which is a good one to test 
before we use it. Other configuration options include flushing the cache for troubleshooting purposes. 
A major benefit of a commercial accelerator is the ability to access analytics on acceleration statistics.

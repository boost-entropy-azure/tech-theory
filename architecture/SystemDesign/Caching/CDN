A content delivery network is a hosted service that takes care of global distribution of static files like images, 
JavaScript, CSS, and videos. It works as an HTTP proxy. Clients that need to download images, JavaScript, CSS, or videos 
connect to one of the servers owned by the CDN provider instead of your servers. If the CDN server does not have the requested 
content yet, it asks your server for it and caches it from then on. Once the file is cached by the CDN, 
subsequent clients are served without contacting your servers at all.

- At most once
- At least once -> idempotent ops
- Artificially idempotent -> Send a retry key with status as true or

Serialize and Deserialize:
----------------------------
- serialization -> Translation of data structure or object into format that can be sent and reconstructed later.
1) Java Object serialization -> Convert object to bystream and receive it as original object state and if both sides it is JVM
All memebers are auto serilized except static and those marked as transient
- Class need to match origin al class defn
- have an acessingle no-args constructor.

public class Data implements Serilizable{
  
  String city;

  int[] ageRange;

}

2) Google's proto buff
3) JSON



- deserialize -> Reconstruct data back to DS or object.

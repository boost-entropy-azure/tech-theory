Static config:
-------------
- Put address of all nodes in a document and give it to all nodes while starting so that they konw each other.
- If one of node restarts, you add the modify the file and provide it to others through automation.
Done using chef or puppet.
- Ephemeral sequential node added under service registry. Each node puts address in znode.

- Each node does getChildren() to get other node and uses getData() to talk to a particular node.
Node will get notified about node children change.

- etcd, consul, netflix eureka

- We still need to distibute the address of zookeeper to all the cluster

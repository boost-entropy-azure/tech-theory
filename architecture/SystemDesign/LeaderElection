Zookeeper: 
- High perf coordinated service designed specifically for distributed systems.
- It provides  an abstraciton layer for higher level distributed algos.
- it is a distributed system itself that provides us high availability and reliability.
- Typically runs in a cluster of odd number of nodes higher than 3
That is right! We will go into more detail very soon, but this is the basis for both breaking the symmetry 
as well as arriving to an unanimous agreement among a potentially large number of nodes

Coding and installation part:
-----------------------------
- Once Zookeeper is downloaded
1) Create a log folder
2) In conf folder, zoo_sample.cfg-> rename to zoo.cfg. that is the config file zookeepr will look at runtime.
Put dataDir param in it to: /Users/vinayak/Downloads/zookeeper-3.4.12/conf/zoo.cfg
3) go to bin directory. Has all files to control zookeeper. sh for mac/linux .cmd -> windows
4) Start zookeeper: ./zkServer.sh start
5) zkCli.sh help us send command to zookeeper and see what is happening wrto java code.

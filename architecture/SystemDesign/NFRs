Scalability:
-------------
- It is defined as the potential of a system, network, or even a 
process to handle a certain number of simultaneous users, sessions, transactions, or 
operations and grow seamlessly as needed.

Reliability : 
---------------
- A system that performs as expected for a specific period of time is 
known as a reliable system.

1.Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): This is defined as the difference of Total Time Elapsed and Total Downtime 
divided by the number of failures.

MTBF = (Total Time Elapsed - Total Downtime)/(Number of failures)

2.Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): This is defined as the average time taken to repair a failed component.

Performance: 
-------------
- Performance is sometimes incorrectly defined as time taken per operation;
- amount of work accomplished compared to the time and resources used
- Good performance, hence, is nothing but the optimum utilization of all resources involved.

A high-performing system may involve one or more of the following: good responsiveness, low resource utilization, 
high throughput and/or availability, short data transmission time, etc.

Responsiveness: 
---------------
Time taken per operation is known as responsiveness

Availability: 
-------------
- A direct effect of scalability is availability.
- A system won’t be considered available if the response time is overly delayed. For example, if an average response 
from a website takes less than one second, 
the system will be considered largely unavailable if the system takes, let’s say, one minute to respond.

Availability (%) = (Total Time Elapsed - Total Downtime)/(Total Time Elapsed)

Fault Tolerance: 
-----------------
Systems that don’t collapse even after failures of certain individual components of a 
system are fault tolerant systems.

Downtime Impact: 
-----------------
It is the impact of the downtime of a server, service, or a resource.

- Creates redundancy
- Copies of data in diff machine.

Master slave apprach of replication:
------------------------------------
- Write goes to master and read goes to slave
- Slave takes over both read and write if master not available.


Master- Master architecture:
-----------------------------
- Each nodes take both read and write.
- Eventual consistency gives us lower latency and higher availability
- Strict consistency slows down the writes -> Used for financial data

Quorum consensus:
------------------
Each document has a version that is updated
R -> Min number of nodes a reader needs to read from
W -> Min number of nodes a writer needs to write to
N -> number of nodes in database cluster


Strict consistency else eventual consistency:
R + W > N

N=5
R=2
W=4

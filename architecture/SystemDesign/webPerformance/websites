- That’s why we want to make sure that the critical styles 
and scripts are downloaded with the HTML file before we download the rest of the scripts and styles.
- Second, since our home page usually gets most of the traffic, 
it’s also a great idea to use a CDN as well as cache the static content.
- Search by text use no sql DB
- What do we do with the static text on the home page? If the text is something that does not change very often, 
we can use a caching database server like Redis. 
Depending on your app, caching could be done on the browser as well as using the second-level cache.

- Images must be optimized per device. A lot of times we can see that it’s the same image and a different 
stylesheet is used per device. This can make pictures look smaller but the mobile device still has to load the 
same image that was created for the desktop. This must be mitigated across the board. Another important thing that 
needs to be done is to optimize the stylesheets such as layout and ensure that paint operations are not triggered 
more often than necessary in the browser. This could be done by using simple techniques as hiding the element, making 
all the changes in the DOM (not the render tree), and then making the element visible again. This way layout will only 
be triggered once. If you need to read more about this I would investigate Virtual Dom approaches as well as frameworks.

Search engine boosting:

What if we have a 27-inch monitor on the sale and it might be priced as much as the 24-inch monitor? We would definitely 
want to boost it up. This means it will show up higher in the search results based on the boosting score we provide. 
This is easier to implement in a search engine than a relational database as boosting is natively supported in a search engine.

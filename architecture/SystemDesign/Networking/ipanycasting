IP Anycasting
When we go to the address bar in a browser and type the name of a website, let’ say http://​cazton.​com, the Border 
Gateway Protocol (BGP) will ensure that the request goes to the Cazton.com server via the best route through the Internet. 
Using IP routing tables, IP Anycasting is smart enough to serve the user’s request from the closest server 
topographically (not necessarily geographically). Typically, anycast is when a group of servers use the same 
IP address. Anycasting uses an IP address range that is advertised in the BGP messages and routers are made 
aware of the topographical path. This way the routers know of which neighbors provide the 
shortest path to the advertised IP address.

The major benefit of this approach is being able to add new servers and making the routers aware of the new 
neighbors that can serve the request faster to a certain set of users. This cuts down on latency and bandwidth costs 
and improves user experience drastically. The main benefits of this approach are seen when you have regions of high 
traffic and the servers are far apart, including across the major oceans. Apart from performance improvement and 
service reliability, it also balances the load and reduces the impact of DoS (or Denial of Service attack). It 
reduces the likeliness of the DoS attack impacting the entire service and reduces it to the local server.

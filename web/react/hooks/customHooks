- Pull out hooks based logic for reusability.
- Use in case you are setting, fetching and returning same thing just with change of URL. 
That is a signal that it should be hooks.


Example:
--------
 const useFetch = (url, initialValue )=>{
     const [result, setResult] = useState(initialValue);
     useEffect(()=>{},[])
     return result;
 }


const x = useFetch(x,y);

box-sizing: border-box; -> If we add padding or border on element, it does not effect the width of it
display:flex -> Center everything
height: 100vh; -> take entire height of browser

Note:
-----
- flex-direction and align-items are related. Alignment will happen accordign to direction. If column then horizontal.

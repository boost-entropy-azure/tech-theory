why graphQL?
------------
- Nesting of URL using nest becomes clumsy
- Get customised pieces of data
- Add data which is not required

Graphql schema:
----------------
- How data in our application is arranged and can be accessed. This is done inside a schema file.


Root Query: 
----------
- It is something that helps us to jump in graph of data. It will have a logic to where in the graph to jump to.
- Its like an entry point into data

Installation:
-------------
- npm init
- npm install --save express express-graphql graphql lodash
- npm install --save nodemon //Post this create a script in package json



Process to follow in graphql:
------------------------------
1) Create types of entities using GraphQLObjectType from graphql lib
2) Create root Query
3) create a schema using root Query
4) use it as schema in expressGraphQL

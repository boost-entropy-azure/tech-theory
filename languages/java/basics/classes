- Ruls for class methods or variable names are that first character must be an letter, underscore  or $
- Statically typed
- If variable is declared at class level, then it will get a default value. If variable is inside a method,
then it will not get a default value. 
- When variable is in method, it is called local variable. When variable is at class level, then it is instance variable.
- At class level, assignments should be done when they are declared mandatorily



When in constructor you dont want parameters to be null:

public Person(String name, int age){
  Objects.requireNonNull(name);
  this.name=name;
  this.age=age;
}

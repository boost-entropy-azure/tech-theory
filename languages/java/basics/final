- Veriable value should not be changed once initialized

public static final double PI = 3.1416 //Implies a constant


final instance variable -> 
- Constant for life of object
- must be initilised in delcaration, constructor, instance initializer


final local variable ->
- constant for life of block

final static variable -> 
- Constnant irrespective of instance
- Mus tbe initilaized in declaration or static initilizer
- All CAPS with _ separated
public static final int MAX_VALUE = 0x7ffff

constant variables -> 
- Values are know at compile time itself 
- it shoudl be primitive
- Shoudl be final or STRING
- MUST Initilize in declaration => Differentiator
- initialized with compile-time constant expression
- final x = 5 -> if not final this will not be replaced below @conpile time.
  final y = 10+x -> now this will be replaced at compile time.

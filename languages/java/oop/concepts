Why static?
-------------
The static keyword signifies that there will be only one copy of this attribute for all the objects instantiated by this class. 

Static methods promote strong coupling to classes. You cannot abstract a static method. You cannot mock a static method or static class. 
You cannot provide a static interface. The only time it is reasonable to use static classes (within application developmentâ€”framework 
development is a bit different) is if you're working with some sort of helper class or extension method that does not produce side 
effects. For example, a static class to add numbers is fine. 
A static class that interacts with a database or a web service is not.


- Java provides an interface called Serializable that provides serialisation and deserialisation


Inheritance represents the is-a relationship

Composition involves using other classes to build more complex classes
Composition represents a has-a relationship. For example, a car has an engine.

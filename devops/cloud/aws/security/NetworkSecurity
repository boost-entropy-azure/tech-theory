Block public ip:
------------------
1) 1st line of defence is NACL -> Deny rule
2) Subset of ip allow in SG
3) Firewall software in Ec2
4) ALB sec group -> Ec2 shuld allow SG of ALB
- NLB does not do connection termination. So no SG.
- Use WAF for ip filtering at ALB level. I tis isntalledon ALB with bunch of rules
- At cloud front level use, cloud front geo restriction or WAF IP address filtering. NACL not helpful here.
- NACL sits at subnet level.It is stateless (Both inbound and outbound apply). Can only refer CIDR. New rules on NACL are all denial rules.

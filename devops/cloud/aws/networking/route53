- Route 53 is a DNS service. It lets you translate domain names to IP addresses.
- The lack of support for ALIAS records (unless they point to AWS resources).
- The lack of DNSSEC support.
- There is a significant benefit in having CloudFormation automatically set up your load balancer together with the DNS records for your custom domain. 
Route 53 makes this possible, whereas if you were to use a different DNS provider, youâ€™d likely have to manage your DNS records manually.
- DNS managment both inside and outside. Use domain names to resolve internal AWS services.

- We can establish health checks at route 53 level

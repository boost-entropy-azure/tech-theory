Want to distribute paid content to premium users all over the world, we can use CloudFront Signed URL/Cookie.
We attach a policy with :
- URL expiration
- IP ranges to access data from
- Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URL)

Signed URL -> Acces to individual files (one signed url per file)
Signed cookies -> access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)
ou would like to provide your users access to hundreds of private files in your CloudFront distribution, 
which is fronting an HTTP web server behind an application load balancer. 

Cloud front signed url:

- CloudFront signed url is allow access to path no matter the origin
- Account wide key-pair, only root can manage it
- Can filter by ip, path data, expiration
- Can leverage caching features


S3 pre-signed url:

- Issue a request as the person who repsigned the url
- Ltd lifetime
- Uses IAM key of the signing IAM principal

- You can think of S3 as a highly-durable hash table in the cloud.
- The key can be any string, and the value any blob of data up to 5 TB.
- You can have as many parallel uploads and downloads as you want, thus, the infinite bandwidth.
- With S3, you pay $5/million uploads and $0.40/million downloads.
- One limitation of S3 is that you cannot append to objects.
- If you have something that’s changing rapidly (such as a log file), 
you have to buffer updates on your side for a while, and then periodically flush chunks to S3 as new objects.
A solution for this issue is to buffer data in a durable queue, such as SQS or Kinesis streams
- It doesn’t support HTTPS when used as a static website host
- A common mitigation is to always add your AWS account ID to the bucket name, which makes conflicts much less likely.
- S3 has an API to check if you own the bucket, and this should always be done before interacting with an existing S3 bucket.

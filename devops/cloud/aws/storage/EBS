- Detach and attach volume to a diff instance in same AZ. Instance and EBS must be in same AZ
- Build in snspshot capability for incremental backup to S3
- Create AMI from snapshots to launch new EC2 instances.
- Volume is replicated within AZ
- EBS created at AZ level
- Built in snapshot capability for incremental backup to S3
- Creates volumes from snapshot(Any AZ in the region)
- Copy snapshots to another region(DR, expansion)
- If multiple volumes attached to EC2, you can use one of the option:

1) Stop the system -> issue snapshot -> restart
2) Take backup at app level (using db s/w)
3) Use the multi-volume consistent snapshot.

- Node which is just below is child and just above is parent
- Degree of a node is number of children it has
- Trees which do not have degree 0 or which are not leafs -> Internal nodes

Application:
-------------
- BST
- Binary heaps
- B and B+ trees for indexing
- Spanning tree used by bridges and shortest path for routers
- Parse trees and expression tress in compilers


Types:
------
- Tries  - Dictionary + prefix search
- Suffix tree - Search patterns in a text
- Segment tree -> Range query searches
- Binary index tree -> Range query searches

- Connects to multiple nodes
- G(V,E)

1) Undirected graph:
--------------------
- degree(v) = number of edges going through it
- sum of degree = 2 * |E|
- Max number of edges = [|v|*(|v|-1)] /2

2)Directed graph:
-----------------
indegree(v) = number of edges coming in to that vertex
outdegree(v) = number of edges going out of that vertex
sum of indegrees = |E|
sum of outdegrees = |E|
Max number of edges = |v|*|v-1|

- Key and sharding strategy must be chosen together to gurantee.
- Chunks are distributed evenly.If chunks are not evenly distributed, they are moved using chunk migration.

- Client -> Router(mongos) -> shards.
Client just need to talk to router via ip address and router will pass query to respective shards.
Also pool of router for fault tolerance.

- Config server (mongod) -> Make decision on where each chunk is going to be located and balancing among shards.
It runs as separate process. This provides information to router.
Config servers will run as replication set and each shard is also run as replication set.
Add more servers or shards.

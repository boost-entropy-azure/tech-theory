--------------------------------
- All daa stored in cassandra is associated with a token.(-2^63 to + 2^63). Each node added takes data associated with contiguous
set of token values
- Storing data with virtual nodes. Each nodes have number of virtual nodes
6 instance each having 4 virtual nodes
- Cassandra is a partition row store. Data is read or written with a partition key. Partition key is hashed into a token 
when data is inserted.Token determines which vnode and actual physical node will be responsible for the data.

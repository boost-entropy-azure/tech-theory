- Data is organised into key spaces -> and each keyspace contains one or more tables -> partition -> Data within partition may be prepresented by one or more rows
- Partiotion is primary interaction point while reading or writing data to cassandra
- Specifics of replication strategy are determined at keyspace level. Determine number of copies of data and where they are stored.


1) Simple Strategy:
-------------------
- Used in dev or single DC
- create keyspace pluralsight with replicate = { 'class':'SimpleStrategy','repplication_factor':3};

2) Network topology strategy:
------------------------------
- create keyspace pluralsight with replicate = { 'class':'NetworkTopologyStrategy','DC1':3,'DC2':1};
- Associate with respective cluster topology to setup respective snitch like gossip protocol

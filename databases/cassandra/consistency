- When client performs an acton it connects to a coordinator node. This node with coordinate comms between client and cluster.
Will determinate whihc node should process to store data.Also coordiantes with replica node

- Tunable consistency is the USP of cassandra. From how many node will it wait to receive ack for the writes

Consistency for reads:

Set it to :
one
two
three
quoram -. When majority of them ack
all
any -> Write can make it to cluster at all.Even coordiantor ack it will tell as success

Hinted handoff -> Even if one node fails, coordinator will persist the data and tries repeatedly to deliver data.
When write successful, daa is removed.


Consistency in reads: how important it is to retrieve latest info.
How many nodes will be consulted to return most current info to the caller.
Retrieve data from on adn digest of data from other.

one
two
three
quoram -> Data and digest from majority nodes will be consulted
ALL

If consistency is all and one of digest returned not mactched, it reads full data from all and 
replaces woring digest with right data.

Periaodically run : Nodetool repari command

Achieving strong consistency:

(Read + Write consistency)> Replicator factor
Quoram Quoram  or one all 


Multi data center consistency:
-------------------------------
- EACH_QUORAM
- LOCAL_QUORAM -> Success where coordinator is located
- LOCAL_ONE

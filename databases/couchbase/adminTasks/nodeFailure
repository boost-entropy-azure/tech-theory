Things to do:
------------
1) Remove and rebalance manually -> Good for planned upgrades, maintanence and scaling in.
2) Failover -> unplanned outages.

Rebalance:
----------
- When node enters or leaves cluster, cluster data and indexes are redistributed across available nodes.
- Happens when new nodes added or joined to cluster. Also, Nodes taken out of cluster via removal or failover.
- Ensure that load is equally distributed across available nodes in cluster
- Mapping from data, indexes to nodes is maintained in a cluster map. This DS is updated and 
redistributed to clients after rebalancing. 
- Cluster continues to accept client requests during rebalancing.

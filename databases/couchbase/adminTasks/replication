NOTES:
-------
- So remember, everytime a bucket is created, 
you need to create 3 replicas for it and then rebalance.
- NOTE: Keep automatic failover on. This is a must



- Replication across data center
- Data evenly distributed and replicated
- Node failure or removal will not lead to any data loss
- Each bucket can have <=3 replicas. NOTE: So remember, everytime a bucket is created, 
you need to create 3 replicas for it and then rebalance.

- If no removal button seen, only way to remove node is rebalance.

Failover:
----------
- Promotion of replicas to active from diff node
- Cluster manager can only deal with active data
- Failover can be :
1) Manual vs Automatic[NOTE: Keep automatic failover on. This is a must]
2) Graceful & Hard

Graceful failover[Means it will be brought back]: (only applicable to data service, for others use removal option)
-------------------
- Proactively remove a node that runs a data service.
- No downtime or loss of client access to data
- replica vBuckets on affected node are demoted to dead
- replica vBuckets on other nodes are promoted to active.

Hard failovers[Mean it might be removed permanently and replaced with a new one]:
---------------
- Applied to all node types
- Should be applied to unresponsive nodes. If applied to functional nodes, writes and replications will be disrupted.
- For data service nodes, replicate vBuckets will be promoted until 1024 are caive again for each bucket.
- It can be manual by administrator or automatic if initiated by cluster manager due to node unavailability.
- Used only incase node is unresponsive or underlying hardware has degraded

Removal vs Failover:
---------------------
- Removal is an option for all types of nodes.
- Removal preserves replica vBuckets from surviving nodes. In failover, some might be lost due to promoted but not replaced.
Due to this rebalancing after failover is important, especially after failover of data service nodes as 
vBuckets need to be redistributed.

Process of graceful failover[Full recovery]  node steps:
------------------------------------------
1) Make note of active and inactive items from servers tab
2) Expand node tab -> failover. No traffic to this node.
Note:  Rebalance -> If you rebalance, that node will be dropped from cluster.
       If delta recovery, all data will be resync to receive update and will not be recreated.
3) DO THIS -> Full recovery + rebalance


Process of graceful failover[Delta recovery]  node steps: [Only Updates are pushed through and it has existing data]
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Make note of active and inactive items from servers tab
2) Expand node tab -> failover. No traffic to this node.
3) DO THIS -> delta recovery + rebalance

This is faster as only updates are being pushed through

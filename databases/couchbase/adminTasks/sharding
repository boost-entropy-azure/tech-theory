V-buckets:
-----------
- Virtual buckets make upa  bucket  and that will help in replication  and optimal data distribution
across a cluster
- V-buckets are impl of buckets



- Couchbase has 1024 fixed shareds also called v-buckets that form one bucket.
1024 v-bucket distributed across node. If 4 node, then each node has 256 vBuckets. If 10K documents, 10k/1024=10 documents per v-bucket.
these 1024 v-buckets are called active v-buckets
- On mac os, it is 64 vBuckets per bucket.
- Document will be in one of the v bucket based on hashing algo
- Based on numbetr of nodes, the v-buckets on each node will be 1024/nodes
- Process of redistributing the v-bucket when adding a node is called rebalancing

- For Every active vBucket , there is a replica vBucket
- Replicas  have separate set of v-bucket called replica-buckets.
If you select 2 replicas, there will be 1024*3=3072 vbuckets.
1024 are v-bucket and 2048 replica v-bucket. 
- Wrtire ops are first on active vBuckets and then propagated to replicas
- Read on replica/active vBuckets.
- Promotion of replicas to active is called failover. 

If we have 0-340 v-bucket in node 1, 0-340 replica v-bucket will lie in other buckets 

- As data changes, it is communicated between nodes using couchbase Data Change Protocol (DCP)
- That's why client need access to every node as the documents are distributed among v-buckets.

- Couchbase has 1024 fixed shareds also called v-buckets.
- Document will be in one of the v bucket based on hashing algo
- Based on numbetr of nodes, the v-buckets on each node will be 1024/nodes
- Process of redistributing the v-bucket when adding a node is called rebalancing


- Replicas  have separate set of v-bucket called replica-buckets.
If you select 2 replicas, there will be 1024*3=3072 replica-buckets.
1024 are v-bucket and 2048 replica v-bucket. 

If we have 0-340 v-bucket in node 1, 0-340 replica v-bucket will lie in other buckets 

- As data changes, it is communicated between nodes using couchbase Data Change Protocol (DCP)
- That's why client need access to every node as the documents are distributed among v-buckets.

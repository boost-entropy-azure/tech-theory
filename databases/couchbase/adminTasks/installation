Cluster creation:
-----------------
1) Questions => Check what machine is recommended by CB
- Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) -> Azure VM
- Public address to VM to SSH and open CB console
- All nodes should be part of same vnet
- Open port 22 for SSH and 8091 for console
- Login to machine. Download couchbase installer
  wget https://......./couchbase-server-enterprise_6.5.0-ubuntu18.04_amd64.deb
- once down, use: sudo dpkg -i couchbase-server....deb
  [4core, 4GB ram recommended]
- Open console and setup cluster. All other services are optional except data.

=> Repeat same step for node 2 till you install everything in the cluster, but when you access the console.
- If you are on same vnet, you can refer other host by using provate ip address and add server from the console opened in first server
- Once server added, click on rebalance
- You can also add host via CLI or REST API

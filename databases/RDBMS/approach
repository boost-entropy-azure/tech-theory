Relational approach :
- Follow a disk first approach for durability
- Write to disk -> Log for availability -> Cache index to memory
- Good for adhoc queries and reports.
- ACID txn control
- Schema predicatability
- Firmly defined schema
- Durable txn

Engaged(E-DBMS):
-Memeory first  for perf
- Cache data and index in memory -> Replicate for availability -> Write to disk
- ORMs map the data in the disk [Lot of joins happen in memory]
- Always on cluster, build to change at scale.

Analytical DB
- Vast batched workloads 
- Focus on retrospective analysis
